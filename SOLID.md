# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> *A class should have a unique reason to be changed, or in other words, the class should have a single responsibility.*

Responsibility â€“ a role of a class that it executes and a reson of changing. 
If a class has more than one reason to change, it has more than one responsibility e.g. it has more than one role. So the SRP is broken here.
