## OOP

**Object Oriented Programming** is a paradigm - a way of thinking about how code can be structured and interrelated. Paradigm - roughly a set of conventions that allows the programmer to transmute the technical specification to code. OOP perfeclty fits human perception of life - we live in the world of objects and we understand well what is is. So when the task is assigned to a OOP programmer - she decomposes it to a set of objects and their methods.

The OOP paradigm is based on '4 pillars of OOP' that are discussed below.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of enclosing variables and functions in some context (class), within which they are united by the same common feature - they all belong to this context (class). An object of the `Car` class will contain the methods that are necessary for the car to move, start, and so on. Among the properties of the `Car` are tank capacity, tire pressure, kilometers traveled and other metrics. Consider the snippet below. The class encompasses only related functional and properties, excluding anything that goes out of car's scope.

```swift
class Car {
  
  // MARK: - Private
  
  private var odometer: ODO?
  private var fuelTank: FuelTank?
  private var tyres: [Tyre]?
	private var engine: Engine?
  
	private func checkPressure(tyres: [Tyre]) -> Bool { 
  	let res = tyres.forEach({ $0.pressure >= 1.5 })
    return res.reduce(false, &&)
  }
	private func checkFueltank(tank: FuelTank) -> Bool { 
  	return tank.fuelVolume > 0 : true : false
  }
  
  // MARK: - Public
  
  public var door: Door?
  public var odoDigitBar: ODO.tripA?
  public var fuelCap: FuelTank.cap = {
    let cap = self.fuelTank.cap
    return cap
  }()
  
  public func lock() { }
  public func unlock() { }
	public func startEngine() { }
  public func drive() { }
}
```

**NB -** that's good to think of encapsulating methods and properties as a [MECE](https://www.preplounge.com/en/bootcamp.php/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle) exercise.

### Abstraction

Abstraction in general terms is a technique of hiding unnecessary implementation details from the user. The user is exposed only to relevant information via `public` properties or methods. For instance, when our `Car()` starts up, it fires up the `startEngine()` public method. 

```swift
public func startEngine() {
  if self.checkPressure(tyres: self.tyres) && self.checkFueltank(tank: self.fuelTank) {
    self.engine.start()
  }
}
```

As you can see from the snippet - the code from the `startEngine()` fires up the private methods to check whether the car has some bad tyre or the fuel is empty. The user just hits the `startEngine()`, but the program makes some logic abstarcted out in private part.

### Inheritance

The process of a sub class heiring the properties and methods from a super class. This allows to eliminate redundant code. Consider all cars should have at least methods and properties as in our `Car` implementation. If the developer had always to re-write this code - his program would soon become overwhelmed by boilerplate. When it comes to inheritance all your `Lexus: Car` and `Porsche: Car` will share the same `fuelTank` property and `startEngine()` method, because `Car` as their superclass implements them in line with other methods and properties.

### Polymorphism

It is the ability of the methods to be redefined by the same name but with different signature. Swift distinguishes between the following polymorphism types:

- Compile time polymorphism: method overloading - changing method's parameters and their types and quantity
- Run time polymorphism - method overriding - though the signature remains untouched, the behavuour of the method is based on wht object called it

## Atomic vs Non-Atomic

## What Happens if You Assign Superclass Object to Subclass Object? (Inheritance)

```swift
class Animal {  }
class Cat: Animal {  }

let animal = Animal()
let cat = Cat()

cat = Animal() // this is ok, as cat inherits from animal thus having all fields and methods
animal = Cat() // animal may not containt data that cat has, so a compiler error is raised
```
